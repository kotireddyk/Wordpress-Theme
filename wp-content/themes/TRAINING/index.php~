        <p>We present Keep Moving Movement 2013 for the Class X students in your school to build their future and to build our nation that must lead the world. We do so with complete gratitude.</p>
        <p>Inspirational living is about developing 'HighSelf Esteem' and practicing daily 'Courage'. Courage, not to be a rebel but the courage, to do, what is &#39;right&#39;!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="txt4">
        Inspiration, imagination, insights, experiences, tools, techniques, games, achievements - contribute in making 'High Self Esteem' not just a concept but a belief.
      </div>
      <div id="txt5">
        By engaging the students by all of the above, we in KMM need your permission to lead our Class X students on the road to 'High Self Esteem'.
        <p>While the teachers at school are doing an incredible job of teaching the minds, the teaching of the heart is becoming the work of specialists.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="txt6">
        <p>KMM, with its volunteers, offers to fill this gap with<br/><span> enthusiasm ans responsibility.</span></p>
        <p>Please allow us to play our part in creating our children, who are thhe torchbearers of the future, who will in turn create a vibrant new destiny</p>

        <p>We believe, teachers combine all of these and much more in their work, year after year and decades after decades!</p>
        <p>At Lifeschool Foundation, we believe that until the "Feeling of inspiration" does not touch us, life is incomplete.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="txt1">
        Because Inspiration is what fills our minds with Imagination.
        <p>Because Inspiration is what fills our hearts with passion.<p>
        Because Inspiration is what fills our bodies with a drive to do, to perform.
      </div>
      <div id="txt2">
        <p>It is the teachers who make us "Feel Inspired!" History is replete with example of great souls who have been shaped and molded by their Teachers, whether it be great scientific minds, intellectuals or even sports personalities. We believe teachers create History and also the Future! The Teachers are a creed that has selflessly devoted itself to such a monumental and important work.</p>
      
        Keeping this in mind, we launched Keep Moving Movement(KMM) in 2010-11. At one end, we wanted to express gratitude to the relentless work the teachers are doing to create the children for the future. On the other end, we wished to interact and together have impactful learning.
        <p>We believe in the concept of "Learning to teach and Teaching to Learn!"</p>
        In 2010-11, we directly touched lives of about 7500 children and 3000 teachers. In 2011-2012, we would have directly touched lives of about 5000 teachers and through them atleast 1,00,000 children. We strongly feel thhat goodness must spread. For the coming year, we have up the ante. We intend to touch about 1,00,000 teachers directly and hence millions of childrens.
